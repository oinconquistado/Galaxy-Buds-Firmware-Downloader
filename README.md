# Galaxy Buds Firmware Downloader

This is a graphical user interface for downloading firmwares for your Galaxy Buds.

### How to use

Go to [website](https://xx.com) and select the firmware you want to download. Then click on the
download button, and the firmware will be downloaded.

## Why i decide to use date to sort the firmware

I decided to sort the firmware by date because the firmware version is too confusing to use, and
users can easily remember the date when updates worked well.

## Technical details

The website is built using [Solidjs](https://www.solidjs.com) and
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The firmware is downloaded using the
[FirmwareProviderAPI](https://github.com/ThePBone/FirmwareProviderAPI) by
[ThePBone](https://github.com/ThePBone/FirmwareProviderAPI).
